# Risk_Modelling_and_Portfolio_Strategies

**Project 1**:

Developed 7 computational investment strategies (Equally weighted, Equal risk contributions, Minimum Variance, Maximum Sharpe Ratio, Leveraged equal risk contributions, and Robust mean-variance optimization, Buy and hold) to identify the optimal approach for varying economic conditions

Backtested the strategies for three periods (2008-2009, 2020-2021, and 2022), resulting in the selection of Minimum Variance, Maximum Sharpe Ratio and Buy and Hold strategies, respectively


**Project 2**:

Developed a portfolio credit risk model incorporating 2 scenarios of systemic risk and idiosyncratic risk in Python (A: 1000 systemic scenarios and 5 idiosyncratic scenarios for each systemic; B: 5000 systemic scenarios and 1 idiosyncratic scenario for each systemic)

Evaluated 99% and 99.9% VaR and CVaR for the portfolios and improved the accuracy of the loss distribution model by adopting non-Normal distribution, achieving a reduction in model error to 5.5%
